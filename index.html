                Never Stop Exploring

            <p>
                Kama is a fun loving and up for anything kind of woman. She loves a good adventure and anything to do with a new experience or outdoors. 
                She was raised by two parents who helped to instill good values in her including family. While still being very family oriented, 
                she still loves to explore things on her own. It is a sort of free spirit personality that she has and she often times doesnâ€™t worry 
                about the small things.<br><br>
