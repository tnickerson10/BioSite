                    There is something about the outdoors that makes Kama feel at peace. The open air, cool
                    breeze and sunlight shining down on her is what makes her soul happy. A good adventure 
                    will never be unappreciated even if it is just for a few hours!

                <p>
                    Traveling is Kama's favorite hobby of all. Even though she may not get to do it as much 
                    she may wish, she is grateful for the many places she has visited. Her favorite place so far
                    has been visiting Hawaii.

                <p>
                    Getting a good workout in is one of the best ways for Kama to keep her 
                    healthy. She loves yoga, a good run and you can find her on her Peloton bike often.
                    When she lived at the beach in San Diego, you could find out on the sand enjoying the
                    beautiful sunsets after a good workout.
