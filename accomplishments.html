                    Getting married was an amazing thing for Kama. She grew up dreaming of her wedding like many
                     girls and when it arrived she was overjoyed. She loves being married and sharing her life with 
                     someone who she can grow with.

                    Completing her Masters degree in teaching was a huge sense of pride. She worked many nights finishing 
                    papers and spent even more in class after long days of working. When she finally finished there was 
                    an overwhelming sense of relief and accomplishment.
